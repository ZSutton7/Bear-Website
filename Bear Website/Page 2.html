                <h1>What to do if you Encounter a Bear in the Wild</h1>
                <p>Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHZ-prhA7E0">Here</a> to watch a short Youtube video on what you should do if you encounter a bear in the wild.</p>
                <p>
                    Lets say you end up getting close and personal to a bear in the wild. What do you do? First off, dont panic. You must stay calm.
                    Remain composed and keep in mind that most bears just want to be left alone; they rarely seek to attack. By charging and abruptly turning away, bears can bluff their way out of a situation. 
                    Additionally, bears have been known to woof, yawn, salivate, growl, snap their jaws, and lay their ears back in a defensive manner. Continue speaking softly to the bear; this will keep you more composed and won't come across as threatening to the animal.
                     An attack could be started by a scream or sudden movement. Never create a high-pitched shriek or bear noises.
                    Pick up young right away. Avoid screaming or making loud noises since the bear can mistake them for the sounds of a prey animal. Asking the bear to move aside requires a slow waving of your arms above your head. AVOID running or making erratic movements. Avoid screaming or making loud noises since the bear can mistake them for the sounds of a prey animal.
                    Join a group to hike and travel. People in groups are typically noisier and more obnoxious than individuals. As a result, groups of people may be seen by bears from longer distances, and because of their combined size, bears find groups to be scary.

                <p>Try to seem as large as you can (for example, move to higher ground).
                    The bear MUST NOT have access to your food. Getting your food will simply feed the bear, aggravating the situation for everyone else.
                    Do not let go of your pack since it can protect your back and keep a bear from getting to your food.
                    Moving slowly and sideways will allow you to avoid stumbling and maintain an eye on the bear if it is immobile. Additionally, moving sideways poses little hazard to bears.
                    Run DO NOT, but halt and hold your ground if the bear pursues. Both uphill and downhill, bears have the same top speed as a racehorse. They will pursue running creatures like dogs do.
                    AVOID climbing trees. Black and grizzly bears can both climb trees.
                    Take a detour or leave the area. If you can't do it, watch for the bear to leave. Always leave a path of escape for the bear.
                    If you spot a female with cubs, exercise extra caution. Never get between a mother and her child, and never try to get close to them. If she sees you as a threat to her cubs, the likelihood of an assault increases significantly.

                <h2>What To do in a bear attack</h2>
                <p>
                    Bear attacks are uncommon; most bears are only concerned with defending food, cubs, or their territory. The best response, though, can be had if you are mentally ready. There are guidelines for how brown bear attacks and black bear attacks can vary, but each circumstance is unique. Most importantly, keep a safe distance from bears!
                    Bears, brown and grizzly: If a bear, brown or grizzly, attacks, keep your pack on and PLAY DEAD. With your hands clasped behind your neck, lie flat on your stomach. To make it more difficult for the bear to turn you over, spread your legs wide.
                     Hold still until the bear moves on. Such attacks typically become more severe when defense is taken. If the assault does not stop, however, fight back vehemently. Hit the bear in the face with whatever you have available.
                    Black bears: DO NOT PLAY DEAD if you are attacked by a black bear. Try to flee to a safe location, like a car or building. If escaping is not an option, make an effort to defend yourself by using anything at hand. Kicks and blows should be focused on the bear's face and muzzle.
                    
                </p>
                <p>
                    This kind of attack is extremely rare but can be very dangerous because it frequently indicates the bear is hungry and views you as its prey. If any bear attacks you inside your tent or stalks you before striking, DO NOT play deadâ€”fight back.
